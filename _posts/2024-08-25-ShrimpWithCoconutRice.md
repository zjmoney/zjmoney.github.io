## At a Glance
Intense caribbean flavors combine in this dish to hit the pallet with a mix of spice and acid over a bed of slightly sweet coconut rice. Once prep is complete, this dish can be assembled in under 5 minutes. Most of the time prepping this recipe is in chopping vegetables.

The salsa and rice are made in advance. The shrimp is cooked quickly for each serving.

## Why it works
Coconut rice and fruit-based salsas tend to be high in calories, especially coming from fat and carbs. To impart the coconut flavor in the rice while keeping the dish healthy, we use lite coconut milk and only half a can. Palm sugar is used in place of cane sugar to help add additional coconut flavor along with the slight sweetness.

The Pineapple in the salsa helps add natural sweetness to the dish, and we drain the juice first to cut down on the sugar and calorie content. We add avocado to the salsa as well to help give the dish a creaminess that would normally come from using full fat coconut milk.
