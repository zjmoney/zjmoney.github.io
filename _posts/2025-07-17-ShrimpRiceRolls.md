## Why it works
Rice rolls are delicious but when made traditionally the wrap is heavy on empty carbs, making them a high calorie food. By using rice paper rolls instead, we can capture the essence of the dish while making it something you don't have to feel bad about eating a lot of.

For the sweetness, we go heavier on the oyster sauce and lighter on the sugar, adding just enough to give them their signature soft sweetness. The chili crisp is a must for anyone who likes a kick to their rolls, so we add less while focusing less on the oil to add the complexity without a ton of fat.

## Prep
#### Filling
1. Pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel to remove as much moisture as possible.
2. Dice the shrimp into equal sized 1/16 in to 1/8 in cubes depending on your liking. The shrimp should be no larger than this. Add to a small mixing bowl.
3. Finely chop the scallions and add them to the mixing bowl.
3. Add all other ingredients  except the corn starch - white pepper salt, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, minced garlic, and minced ginger - to the mixing bowl.
4. Add the corn starch and immediately mix until everything is well combined.

#### Rolling Station
1. Fill a bowl large enough to fully submerge a rice paper sheet with warm-to-hot water

2. Separate out 6 rice paper sheets
3. Lightly spray a steam-safe plate with oil for cooking. The plate should be small enough to fit in your steamer, or use multiple plates for a double-stacked steamer.
4. Wet a cutting board to use as your prep station. Arrange the prep items next to each other so you can quickly roll the material.

#### Sauce
1. Mix together soy sauce, oyster sauce, brown sugar, and a splash of water until the sugar has dissolved.

## Cook
1. Heat a pan to a gentle boil.
2. Place a rice paper in the water for 8-10 seconds, then place it on the cutting board.
3. Fill the paper with 1/6 of the filling, then carefully fold in the sides and roll it. The filling should go between the back third and middle of the roll. Carefully fold the paper over the filling, then roll it through the rest of the rice paper.
> If the rice paper is wet enough, it should be easily malluable without folding in on itself and being difficult to grasp. You will need to play around with submerged timing since water temperature plays a roll in this.

4. Carefully place the roll on your steaming plate.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the rest of your rolls. As the water cools down, you may need to submerge the rice paper for slightly longer.
6. Lightly spray the tops of the rolls with more oil, place the plate in your steamer, and place the steamer on the pot of boiling water.
7. After 6 minutes, remove the steamer from the stove and open the top. DO NOT open the steamer during cooking.
8. Remove the plate, pour the sauce over the rice rolls, then carefully add an equal amount of chili crisp to each roll.
> Since rice paper is a bit firmer than traditional rice rolls, it may be easier to use a spoon to eay (no one is judging!)
