## Why it works
Creamy udon is a fantastic but usually very heavy dish. The ratio of milk and greek yogurt allows us to imitate the creaminess while avoiding how heavy it would usually be. By using less yogurt we're also able to avoid some of the curdling that would normally come as a tradeoff.

For the chicken, we use honey and mayo instead of sugar and oil to help get the nicely caramelized sear and sweetness with far less calories. Combining the noodles with the gochujang glaze early in the pan helps the cream and seasonings stick to the noodles better as well and creates a better texture for the dish.

Finally, the lemon juice being added at the last step adds a dash of acid that really brings out the sweetness of the elements already in the dish. Doing this at the end makes sure none of that acid is rendered out on accident either. The result is a surprisingly rich dish with fantastic macros.

## Cook
#### Chicken
1. In a medium pan, spray oil and turn to high heat. At the same time, fill a small pot with water and bring to a boil.
2. Once the pan starts to smoke, pour the chicken mixture onto it and arrange into a single sheet.
3. Allow the chicken to cook 1-2 minutes until you can see it beginning to cook-through. Once this occurs, mix and toss the chicken such that it is coated evenly in the caramelizing sauce. The chicken should become coated dark brown.
4. Cook for another 30 seconds, then remove the chicken from heat and put contents into a bowl. The chicken should be 80% cooked at this point.

#### Udon
1. Add the udon noodles to the boiling water and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then drain.

> You can throw in the udon noodles just before you toss the chicken to speed things up.

#### Finishing
1. Place the pan back on the stove at medium heat and add the gochujang glaze. Once the sauce starts to bubble, add the udon noodles and mix until they are well coated. Allow them to satay for 30 seconds.
2. Add the "cream" sauce to the pan and mix well. Let cook for 2 minutes, until sauce begins to thicken.
3. Add the cooked chicken back to the pan and mix together. Allow to cook for another minute, until the sauce is visibly thick.
4. Splash lemon juice, mix, then turn the pan off.
5. Fold in the parmesan cheese, place in a serving bowl, and sprinkle basil on top to serve.
