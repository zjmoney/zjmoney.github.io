## Why it works
Generally a shrimp po'boy or avocado shrimp uses heavier ingredients such as oil, butter, and full-fat mayo. We supplement the mayo with a blend of light mayo and 0% greek yogurt to create a similar flavor and consistency with much better macros. By using chipotle peppers and diced red bell peppers, we are able to give the dish a more full flavor than by using chipotle and paprika alone for seasoning.

Using and not frying shrimp for this keeps our calories down a lot as well. Glazing and cooking the shrimp together with the sauce at the end also helps bring all the flavors together.
