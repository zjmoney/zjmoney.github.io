## Why it works
Generally when making recipes healthier through the use of chicken breast and 0% greek yogurt, the texture becomes tart and dry. This is undesirable. To get around this, we add lemon juice to the chicken marinade and marinate for a full 24 hours. The lemon juice breaks down the internal fibers of the chicken and tenderizes it. The yogurt mixes with the juices let from the chicken to cut down on tartness before cooking.

For the sauce we use 0% greek yogurt, but in order to impart the buttery richness that is expected we do not forego the butter. The larger amount of tomatoes used here adds more acid as well, cutting tartness from the yogurt. To balance this acid, we cook the rice with chicken bone broth to make it heartier. This heartiness helps balance the dish overall to give it the fullness we expect.

2. Spray oil in a pan and place it on high heat.
3. Once the pan begins to smoke, add the marinated chicken at high heat in a single layer.
4. Place the rice plate in the microwave and microwave for one minute.
5. Allow the chicken to cook without touching for around 2 minutes, until one side is somewhat charred.
6. Turn the heat to medium. Stir fry the chicken around, and then pour the tikka masala sauce onto the top of it. Mix again and cover.
7. Allow the chicken to cook for around 4 minutes, then uncover and stir again.
8. Cook for 1-2 more minutes uncovered so that the sauce thickens up, then remove from heat and rest. The chicken will complete cooking while resting.
9. Place the contents of the pan over the rice, sprinkle cilantro over the top, serve, and enjoy.
