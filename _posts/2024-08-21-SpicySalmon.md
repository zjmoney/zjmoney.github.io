## At a Glance
This recipe gets the full flavor of a great red thai curry without having to sacrifice macros around heavy carbs and fats. Full disclosure I ate this for a month straight and didn't get bored of it.

The sauce and rice is made in advance, with the salmon being flash fried to ensure a fresh taste with every meal.

## Why it works
Curries generally depend on the full fat coconut milk to give them that rich, Unami flavor. Using full-fat coconut milk is a non-starter from a macros standpoint, so in addition to lite coconut milk we add chicken bullion, lime zest, and fish sauce to add a richness.

To give the sauce its signature sweetness we also forego as much sugar and add a minced yellow chili pepper to bring some natural sweetness. The lime juice also helps bring out the sweetness with some extra acidity and using fresh chili peppers brings extra flavor that using powder or flakes lacks.

## Prep
#### Rice
1. In a rice cooker, add 180g jasmine rice and 320g water. Add a pinch of salt and cook.
2. Once the rice is complete, weigh it to determine the per-serving weight.

> Expected total weight is just over 400g but depends on rice wetness

#### Curry Base
> Make sure to prep all ingredients before beginning to cook the curry base. It is easy to accidentally burn the chiles and paste
{: .prompt-tip }

1. Finely mince the red and yellow chili peppers. Add them to a sauce pan along with the canola oil, garlic, and ginger paste
2. In a small mixing bowl, add the curry paste and chicken bullion.
> Optionally, add MSG to this bowl
3. In a second small mixing bowl, add lime juice, palm sugar, lime zest, and fish sauce.
4. Set the sauce pan on a burner at high heat. Saute the peppers, garlic, and ginger until they are soft, but not burned _(about 3 minutes)_ stirring occasionally.
5. Turn the heat down to medium and add in the bowl with curry paste and chicken bullion. Stir to mix all ingredients. Then stir often until curry paste begins to reduce.
6. Add the can of coconut milk and stir until it turns a red color, then add the water. With the heat at medium, bring to a simmer while stirring occasionally.
7. Add the final mixing bowl ingredients to the sauce. Mix together and turn the burner to medium-low. Allow to simmer for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
8. Add the final salt to taste. 
> Mix the sauce thoroughly before tasting. At this stage, if it tastes slightly acidic that is ok. The rice will balance this
9. Take the sauce off heat and transfer to storage container. Weigh the sauce to ensure equal-portions. 

> Expected weight is around 600g. Add a dash of water if under.

## Cook
1. Portion out one serving of rice onto a plate and one serving of sauce into a small mixing bowl
2. Pat-dry the salmon filet with paper towels. Then season the salmon with salt
3. Spray a pan with oil and place on high heat
4. Once the pan begins smoking, place the salmon filet skin-down and allow to sear (around 2 minutes). Push down with your spatula on the top of the filet to help get an even sear.
5. Flip the salmon and turn the heat down to medium. At the same time, add the spinach to the other side of the pan and stir frequently
> _Optional:_ Peal the skin off the salmon and set it aside to keep it crispy.
6. Once the spinach has mostly wilted, pour the sauce directly on the salmon and immediately cover with a lid. Let cook for around 2 minutes.
8. While the salmon is cooking, heat the rice in the microwave for 1 minute.
9. Remove the lid from the pan and stir the filet, spinach, and sauce, then remove from heat. Let stand for 1 minute to allow salmon to finish cooking.
> If the sauce looks too watery. allow an extra 15-30 seconds cooking to thicken it.
10. Pour the pan contents over the rice, sprinkle cilantro on top, and enjoy
